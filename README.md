# Task
It is necessary to develop an application with the possibility of direct and reverse geocoding (from coordinates to an address and vice versa). It is not required to deploy your own database with addresses, it is enough to use third-party APIs (Google, Yandex, etc.). Thus, the application is a caching proxy service for a third-party geocoding service. The application must provide an API with JSON data format.

#### Requirements
- Java/Kotlin
- Spring boot
- Caching query results. As a cache, you can use an SQL database (MySQL, Postgres, etc.), or a NoSQL solution (Memcached, Redis, etc.).
- Logging errors and the operation of the application as a whole.
- Test coverage of basic functionality.

#### Optional (would be an advantage)
- Application performance metrics (Actuator, Dropwizard, others).
- Building and running the application in Docker.
